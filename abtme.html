<p1>I'm born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, and have played football for <br> 
    as long as I could remember, and have loved coding since i was about 9. </p1>

    I have mutiple hobbies, such as fishing, playing football, listeing to music <br>
    and playing video games. While there are more, these are the main few. <br>
    I would say out of these the most common one I partake in, besides football <br> 
    is playing video games. They serve as a release, and are also a lot of fun. <br>
    Plaing with friends from home is also nice to stay connected with them.
